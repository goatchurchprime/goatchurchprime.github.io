# Stuff to do.  Some of which can be combined

* Surfski portugal in February http://sashaz.com/?p=1472 surfskicenter

* Kayak dive farne islands.  (also flamborough head)

* Dive tour marine parks Croatia (cold water)

* Lydia-SUSS 9 easy canyons and 1 long wet through trip in Jura

* XTC HG tour Slovenia/Soca http://xtc-paragliding.com/holidays/dates.html

* HG Tour dolomites http://adventureflying.at/ (with Sasha, so lots of interesting characters)

* Via Ferrata Dolomites (take a 3rd person on HG tour so Becka can go with them)

* Tag along on a group canyon trip in North Italy so Becka can skip doing the fun ones

* Kayak dive+explore Orkneys and Scappa Flow

* XC Ski trip Norway A&J hut.  Long way, so should also see other places around, like St Petersburg.  
Take advantage of low rates on ferries

* Red sea diving, for 3 weeks (plane flights make me sad), but unable to tour rest of Egypt as 
still dangerous now and Becka has already done it.

* Sea kayak camping tour Scotland from Oban, lightweight train journey like Martin does

* Book Becka in for a course at http://www.ledeltateam.com/ for proper excitement and fun 
when everything else feels jaded

* MTB day and rental in North Wales, other places than Llandegla

* Intermediate surfing day at Conwy surf wave lake

* White water river canoing

* Penyghent extensions in skinny wetsuit so we all fit

* HG winching in suffolk for Julian to learn to land (and cycle tour the place)

* Lancaster kayak round trip.
